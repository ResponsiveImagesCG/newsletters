# Big numbers

Teaser text: 120 million users and a quarter of all websites.

## `picture` support ships to 120 million Windows 10 users

A few months after landing in the Microsoft Edge developer preview releases, `picture` [made its way into an official Windows 10 auto-update][picture-drop].

So: every desktop browser except for Safari is shipping `picture`. For the fruit company, we wait.

## WordPress progress

Versions 3 (and 3.1!) of the official RICG responsive images plugin for WordPress [have landed][ricg-wp]. If you've been using the plugin, upgrade! Version 3 deprecates its core functionality, which is being merged into WordPress 4.4 Core. Joe McGill wrote [an excellent explainer about the 4.4 changes][joe-post] over on the WordPress Core development blog.

Have I mentioned that [WordPress powers a quarter of the web][wp-quarter]? And that respimg landing in Core is going to do more for respimg adoption than anything else ever has or likely ever will? And that this is going to happen on December 8th? I have? You knew this? Good!

## Grab Bag

- Vox has been deploying respimg across their properties, resulting in some [eye][sbnation]-[popping][verge] performance gains.
- Seeing double downloads in Chrome? Yoav just cleaned up [a][width-for-height] [handful][non-mobile] [of][cached] nasty bugs that were conspiring to cause them.
- Rachel Andrew, Perch proprietor and CSS-Grids-expert, recently published [a reflection on how and why CSS Grids has evolved over the past few years][css-grid]. It’s a fascinating long view of how the sausage gets made and everything about it — from the the frustration at pace and process to the pride and satisfaction in the end result — felt very, very familiar.
