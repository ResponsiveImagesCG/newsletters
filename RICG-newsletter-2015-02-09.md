# The Hard Part

I'm going to open with a quote from Jason Grigsby, from his recent appearance on [the UIE Brain Sparks podcast](http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2015/02/02/jason-grigsby-real-world-responsive-web-design/):

> I think even though responsive images is something that we’ve been talking about for quite some time, that really 2015 is going to be the year that web developers as a whole now are going to be, “Now we’ve got the tools. How do we use them?”

The RICG researched use cases, called them “responsive images,” built consensus around a solution and got that solution into specs and browsers. Now comes the hard part: how do we, both as individual developers working on individual projects, and as evangelists looking to respimg-ify the web as a whole, get responsive images into *webpages*?

[It’s complicated](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-respimg/2015Jan/0003.html). That’s a flowchart that Jason made in preparation for his An Event Apart talk, which was a little bit of a revelation for me – so many boxes! A spaghetti of arrows! And yet as I followed each branch of the decision tree I saw plain as day that they were all necessary and that by talking and writing about this stuff for two years, I’d internalized each and every one.

Responsive images pose complex problems, which we’ve answered with a cabable, flexible (and dare I say elegant) set of markup-based solutions. How do we manage that complexity in the real world?

## These people have

- @RWD asked for examples of respimg in action and [a few of his 112K followers obliged](https://twitter.com/RWD/status/560114266137985026). The replies contain a wealth of real-world examples from everyone from Shopify to my alma mater.

## Wordpress is figuring it out, too
