**SHORTDESC:** Yoav wrote an article, everyone is giving talks in September, and I get on an airplane!

> Our story starts in ancient times, when WURFLs roamed the wilderness, and mobile-only websites were a thing.

So begins [Yoav Weiss’ excellent introduction to the new markup on Dev.Opera](http://dev.opera.com/articles/native-responsive-images/). 

It’s not often that we get to read a friendly, accessible, educational (and funny!) article about a new HTML feature penned by the very same person who is implementing that feature in two major browsers. *C’est la RICG*: bridging gaps and breaking barriers. 

When I am old and gray, I hope to be able say that the RICG’s main contribution to the web platform *wasn’t* `picture`, `srcset`, or `sizes`. They’re wonderful and they’ll make websites faster for everybody forever, but they’re just one set of features. To get them done we had to punch a hole through the thick technical, cultural, and institutional walls that separate the people who make browsers from the people who make websites. The lines of communication we’ve built between the different sets of people who write specifications, HTML, and C++ for a living seem more valuable than any one feature. *That’s* what I hope to look back on with the most pride. 

Bridging gaps is, of course, significantly easier when you’re able to crowdfund a Renaissance-man like Yoav who can contribute meaningfully at every level. [Go read his article!](http://dev.opera.com/articles/native-responsive-images/)
