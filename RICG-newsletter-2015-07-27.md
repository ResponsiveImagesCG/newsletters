# Shortie

If you’re reading this, I’m on vacation. Just a few notes this time ’round:

- Our friends at the [WICG](https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/) have adopted the Specifiction discourse board and given it a happy new home: [discourse.wicg.io](http://discourse.wicg.io). Implementors, spec editors, and developers all bouncing ideas off of one another under the same roof: it’s a beautiful thing.

- Hey, we were shortlisted for a couple of those Net awards! [Best New Web Technology](https://thenetawards.com/vote/web-tech/), [Best Collaborative Project](https://thenetawards.com/vote/collaboration/), woo.

- The fix for Firefox’s won’t-re-evaluate-respimgs-on-resize bug [looks like](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1135812#c71) it’ll be bumped from v42 up to v41, which ships in late September. Woo?

See you in a couple of weeks!
