# One year

> One year ago today, we held a @respimg browser-vendor meetup at Paris. We left it with an "all is lost" kinda feeling. Funny how things go.

Indeed. I remember waking up at an ungodly hour, half a world away from [that meetup](http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/2013/09/18/paris-responsive-images-meetup/), making myself a strong pot of tea, struggling to open the live stream, and proceeding to hear browser vendor after browser vendor mistake pieces of the responsive images problem for the whole and/or put the kibosh on a multi-element markup solution. I lobbed a few Qs from the peanut gallery (IRC room) before shuffling off to work, groggily consoling myself that, “well, at least we’ll have srcset=1x/2x.”

Fast forward to the present day. The RICG’s humble `picture` repo is now being piped directly into the official specs. The spec’s first full implementation ships (in Chrome 38) in a week or three. The RICG is being widely hailed as a success and a template – a place where developers, spec editors, and browser vendors all came together to understand each other’s pain points and make the web a better place.

The big, open questions are no longer about what the new markup should *be*, or how it should *work*, but about how [dev](https://shoehornwithteeth.com/ramblings/2014/09/potential-browser-devtools-support-for-responsive-images/) [tools](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=415147) should [present it](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1064715).

[New tutorials](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/responsive/picture-element/) are being posted every week (and, if you’ll excuse a little horn-tooting, [an old one was just translated into Japanese!](http://terkel.github.io/srcset-sizes/)). [Jason Grigsby has ceased advising conference rooms full of people to hedge their responsive image bets](http://blog.cloudfour.com/updating-responsive-image-guidelines-in-preparation-for-aea-austin/) and Bruce Lawson is already [casting](https://twitter.com/brucel/status/510026698939969536) [the](https://twitter.com/brucel/status/510028240413798401) [movie](https://twitter.com/brucel/status/510029214733840385).

Editor Simon Pieter’s focus has shifted from ironing out all of the little devils in the details of the spec to ensuring that those details are implemented correctly; he’s been busy building [a suite of Web Platform Tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/1234).

And now that the new markup in browsers and specs, all that’s left is the enormous task of getting it into as many *webpages* as possible, via developer evangelization and education. I mentioned a couple of newsletters ago that various RICG-folk had talks in September; slides from [Dave Newton’s (excellent) talk at the National Association of Government Web Professionals](https://speakerdeck.com/newtron/improving-performance-with-responsive-images-nagw) and [Yoav’s (stellar) talk at Velocity](https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/newsletters/issues/57) are now both available online.

What a difference a year makes.

See you in a couple of weeks!
