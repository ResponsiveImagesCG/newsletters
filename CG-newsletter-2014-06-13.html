<h1>LGTM</h1>

<h2>Three browsers by Halloween</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org/">Firefox Nightly</a> now includes <code>srcset</code> and <code>x</code>-descriptor support behind a flag – instructions on how to enable and test the feature are <a href="http://codepen.io/RICG/pen/poKfj">here</a>. The feature should be on-by-default <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1018389">shortly</a> and <code>sizes</code>, <code>w</code> descriptors, and <code>picture</code> support are <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=picture">right around the corner</a>. Nothing is certian, but if things keep progressing apace, full <code>picture</code> spec support should be shipping on-by-default in FireFox 33 on October 14th.
</p>

<p>
Over on the Blink side of things, <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> received [the three magical “LGTM”s](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/GRfwz951FHo) they needed to come out from behind their experimental feature flag and should be on-by-default in M38 — shipping in Chrome 38 stable on September 26th and Opera 25 around the same time.

<h2>Webkit’s not <em>too</em> far behind</h2>

<p>
Yoav has successfully wrangled the existing WebKit <code>srcset</code> implementation into shape, <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133504">aligning it with the spec</a> and setting the stage for <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133620">`sizes` support</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/helloanselm/status/473719818756317184">Rumor has it</a> that iOS 8 even supports <code>x</code> descriptors in <code>srcset</code>. Baby steps!</p>
<h2>In the meantime, Picturefill...</h2>
<p>PictureFill 2.1, which brings <code>srcset</code> parsing in-line with the spec, hit <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill/releases/tag/2.1.0-beta">beta</a>.</p>

<p>
If you haven’t given Picturefill a go yet, you really should code like it’s 2015 and give it a whirl. If you <em>are</em> using it, <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill/issues/258">let them know</a>!

<h2>And hey! Weren’t those <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1471972-Responsive-Images-Community-Group-IndieGogo-Campaign">t-shirts</a> great?</h2>

<p>
I got mine in the mail last week and I just want to say that they’re really terrific. Thanks again to <a href="http://www.hellogeri.com/">Geri Coady</a> for the design, <a href="http://www.unitedpixelworkers.com/">United Pixelworkers</a> for the printing, and RICG chair <a href="https://twitter.com/wilto">Mat Marquis</a> for running logistics. And thanks most of all to all of you for buying them and <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/picture-element-implementation-in-blink">making Yoav’s tireless implementation work possible</a>!
</p>

<p>
We’ve been getting a lot of questions about how to buy the shirts now that the campaign is over. We don’t have anything firm to report yet but we’re looking into our re-print options. If you missed the boat on these, keep an eye out!
</p>

<p>
See you in a couple of weeks!
