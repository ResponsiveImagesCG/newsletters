# Use Cases, Use Counters, and Stickers
**Teaser Text:** Tryptophan-and-gratitude delayed Cyber Monday RICG newsletter edition

## Element Queries progress

We at the RICG are simultaneously working to both cleanly define the *problems* that element queries aim to solve, while also getting our hands dirty experimenting with a particular possible *solution*.

On the problem definition front — [it has come to our attention](http://ircbot.responsiveimages.org/bot/log/respimg/2014-11-19#T102038) that the use cases doc has heretofore gotten a teensey-weensie bit ahead of itself, by proposing a specific solution rather than cleanly, simply, and thoroughly defining the problem at hand. Mat took [a first pass at cutting the fat](https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/eq-usecases/commit/7c5de85e99feefe830cc73811ad4a5129dd43f0c), but work remains to be done.

The [responsive images use cases document](http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/) served as a rock and a guiding light through the three-year onslaught of failed respimg proposals. We need, above all else as we embark on this journey, a strong use cases doc. Help us write one.

Simultaneously, the RICG is taking a stab at realizing a proposed solution. Johnathan Neal has a functional (totally experimental, and never-to-be-supported) [element query prototype](https://github.com/jonathantneal/hitch-element-queries) up and running. Johnathan’s repo is a hacky little glimpse of one possible EQ ending, right here at the beginning of our story, which we can use to concretely explore the problem space, [write demos](https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/eq-demos), and provide feedback that will inform EQ work going forward. Huzzah!


## [Picturefill 2.2 hit stable](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill/releases/tag/2.2.0)

And we’re going to need more hands on keyboards to get 2.3 out the door. Mat wrote an eloquent plea [here](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill/issues/374).


## Speaking of Mat writing eloquently

True story: I drove 800 miles to Kansas City a fortnight ago to be a best man in a wedding and only *then* did it dawn on me that I wouldn’t be able to write both a toast and a newsletter before Friday. Oops. Mat bailed me out — [in fine form](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-respimg/2014Nov/0018.html). Thanks, Mat.


## Respimg deployment is spiking

A while back I got pretty excited about chromestatus.com adding use counters for responsive image features. I did so in anticipation of being able to show you [charts](https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/524) [like](https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/523) [these](https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/521): responsive image markup adoption is surging like a bat out of aitch-eeee-triple-[hockey-sticks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_stick_graph).


## Hey, RICG stickers!

There are [RICG stickers](http://www.stickermule.com/user/1069094592/stickers)! Stuff stockings accordingly.


## Leftovers

I always loved a good turkey sandwich.

- Jason Grigsby will be talking respimg at Event Apart in Seattle and Atlanta in the coming months, 
- [Mat will be speaking about respimg, too](http://www.meetup.com/boston_JS/events/218914814/) – at Boucoup on December 17th in Boston.
- Steven Bradley over at Vanseo design has been on fire recently, posting a [series of great posts](http://www.vanseodesign.com/tag/responsive-images/) about the new respimg features, culminating most recently in [this nifty demo](http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/responsive-images-demo/).
- Emil Björklund threw up [a little JSBin](http://jsbin.com/noxuze/) which shows and tells the benefits of using `picture` to deliver WebPs with JPEG fallbacks.
- Jonathan Hollin [wrote up his personal respimg workflow](https://www.perpetual-beta.org/weblog/srcset-production-factory.html), which uses [Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php) to automatically generate variously-sized sources and a markup snippet as soon as the images are dropped in a folder.
- Scientia Mobile wrote [an article]((http://www.scientiamobile.com/page/responsive-images-specification-real-world-scenarios)) explaining the thinking behind their new (device-detection-centric) server-side auto-resizer, which stirred up some [ambivolent](https://twitter.com/yoavweiss/status/538258500372422656) [react](https://twitter.com/wilto/status/538413818763030528)[ions](https://twitter.com/wilto/status/538414438664372224).
- Finally, [this is in German so I can’t read it](http://rocksolidthemes.com/de/contao/blog/responsive-images-picture-contao) (but it looks mighty fine!).

See you in a couple of weeks!
