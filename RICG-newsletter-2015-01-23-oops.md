# Oops

I have a rather embarrassing correction to the most recent newsletter, which, due to my own negligent proofing and reckless use of the [Cloud To Butt Plus Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloud-to-butt-plus/apmlngnhgbnjpajelfkmabhkfapgnoai?hl=en) contained a broken link and referred to the Cloud Four blog as “my Butt Four blog”.

The correct link to Jason Grigsby’s post about using `picture` and `source` for type-switching is:

[http://blog.cloudfour.com/when-to-use-picture-for-resolution-switching/](http://blog.cloudfour.com/when-to-use-picture-for-resolution-switching/)

I am an ass. The extension has been uninstalled. My deepest apologies to the Cloud Four team.
