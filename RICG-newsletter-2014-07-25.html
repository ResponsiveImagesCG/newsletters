<small><p><b>Short description:</b> Picture is absolutely shipping in Opera 25 and Chrome 38 and I make a number of questionable music references.</p></small>

<h2>The Fat Lady Sings</h2>

<p><strong><em>Mamma don't take my code-a-Chrome-38</em></strong></p>

<p>With the necessary <a href="https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/newsletters/blob/master/RICG-newsletter-2014-07-11.md#responsive-elements-in-blink--complete-picture-implementation-imminent">responsive-element foundations</a> laid, Yoav posted an <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/t3KRycUCGA8">“intent to ship” thread</a> re: the <code>picture</code> element over on the Blink-dev mailing list this week; the feature received the necessary support. Meaning that, barring any crazybugs, meteor strikes or other such unforeseen calamities, the <code>picture</code> element is finally, officially, <em>definitely</em> going to ship <a href="https://codereview.chromium.org/401403003/">un-flagged</a> in Chrome 38 (in late September/early October) and Opera 25. Canary builds from here on out will support the feature by default, too.</p>

<p>Much implementation work remains to be done. <code>picture</code>, <code>srcset</code>, and <code>sizes</code> have been fully implemented in Gecko but are still behind flags in Firefox Nightly. The WebKit implementation has a ways to go. We’re still waiting on an official “yes, we’re implementing this” from IE. And it will take a while for these features to trickle down to mobile browsers, where they’re needed most. But! It feels great to have one foot, firmly planted.</p>

<h2>dev.Opera posted an excellent introductory article</h2>

<p><strong><em>Le nozze di Figuring-out-the-new-markup-by-example-o</em></strong></p>

<p>Andreas Bovens posted <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/responsive-images/">something great</a>. I particularly like how he emphasizes the link between markup features and use-cases, and accompanies each example with a graphical key so that you can tell what problems the markup is trying to solve at a glance.</p>

<p>When <a href="
http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2014/on-the-complexity-of-the-picture-element/">linking to the article</a>, Andreas’ fellow Opera employee (and <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2011/notes-on-adaptive-images-yet-again/"><code>picture</code> element sorta-kinda-inventor</a>) Bruce Lawson offered these words of encouragement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if dumb brain like mine can understand,sure your can.</p>

<h2>Assorted tools you can use</h2>

<h3>...to lose those validation blues</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator</a> now accepts and provides helpful advice on the new markup.</p>

<h3>Or perhaps you look better in red?</h3>

<h3>View source, up-sped</h3>

<p>Mat Marquis wrote a Chrome extension which calls out pages using <code>picture</code> with a little badge (of approval, presumably). It’s called “<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/picture-in-play/mkhhihpihdlghkddhnadficgndpoigja">Picture in Play</a>”. Mike Taylor quickly coded-up a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/picture-in-play/">Firefox add-on  that does the same thing</a>; they both live in <a href="https://github.com/Wilto/Picture-in-Play">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<h2>In your “I”s</h2>

<p><strong><em>♫ the light, the heat ♫</em></strong></p>

<p>Finally, as the RICG begins to look beyond responsive <em>images</em> – to element queries, and beyond – we realize that we need a new name. Or at least a new “I.” We’ve set up a suggestion box <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1dblfSFkzsdQtdilg_xpbcufHuvSW4r761xWHEm3t8W0/viewform">here</a>.</p>

<p>And yes, <a href="https://twitter.com/wilto/status/492323152303636480">“Insaneclownposse” has already been suggested</a>.</p>

<p>See you in a couple of weeks!</p>
