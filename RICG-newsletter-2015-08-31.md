# Steering gigantic ships
Microsoft and WordPress, full steam ahead

## Edge progress

`picture` is officially [“In Development”][in-dev] on Microsoft’s official status page. Even better: the latest Microsoft Edge build [now supports][sup] `w` descriptors and `sizes`! Go Redmond, go.

## Bringing responsive images to WordPress core

The [official responsive images plugin for WordPress][wp-ricg] currently sports “10,000+” active installs. Joe McGill recently penned [a post over on the WordPress Core blog][joe-post] about the effort to land the plugin’s functionality in Core, so that all million-bajillion of WordPress’ users will get respimg functionality *automatically*.

Joe outlines the issues left to conquer (and there are more than a few of them — WordPress’ image-handling is old, stable, and resistant to change), and calls on all interested to contribute. [Contribute!][joe-post]

## 101 done

Jason Grigsby has completed his stupendous <cite>Responsive Images 101</cite> series with a pair of posts: one on [image breakpoints][ibreak], the other, a [conclusion][concl].

Jason has thought about image breakpoints more than anyone — I’m pretty sure he coined the term? — and it shows. After outlining the problem and a bunch of different ways to think about tackling it, Jason ends with a section called “Humans shouldn’t be doing this” and a plea for developers and CMSs to shield content creators from having to do the confounding, tedious work of creating and managing multiple alternate image resources.

And Jason’s conclusion is excellent; celebrates how far we’ve all come, points to the future, discusses a bunch of possible “201” topics in brief, and implores us all to “Please share what you learn!” Here here!
