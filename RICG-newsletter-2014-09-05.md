## Blowing up

Ars Technica published a [Sunday-night feature about the history of the RICG](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/09/how-a-new-html-element-will-make-the-web-faster/)… and the internet weighed in.

The feature (written by Scott Gilbertson) is excellent! [Go read it](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/09/how-a-new-html-element-will-make-the-web-faster/) if you haven’t already. Whereas most of the many articles about `picture` have been explanatory how-to tutorials written for web developers – focusing how the new markup works and how to use it – the Ars piece is all about people and process. It tells the story of the spec’s inception and maturation for the benefit of a general (though still tech-y) audience.

And boy, did that audience have things to say in response. The internet commentary that’s sprung up in the article’s wake is full of [pedantry](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/09/how-a-new-html-element-will-make-the-web-faster/?comments=1&post=27500637#comment-27500637), [hyperbole](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/09/how-a-new-html-element-will-make-the-web-faster/?comments=1&post=27501505#comment-27501505), [hand-wavy reductionism](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8257830), [jokes](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/09/how-a-new-html-element-will-make-the-web-faster/?comments=1&post=27499265#comment-27499265), [misinformation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8257888), [excitement](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/09/how-a-new-html-element-will-make-the-web-faster/?comments=1&post=27499743#comment-27499743), [congratulations](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/09/how-a-new-html-element-will-make-the-web-faster/?comments=1&post=27499141#comment-27499141), the inevitable suggestions that we should [just use CSS](http://gizmodo.com/you-can-already-do-something-similar-with-media-queries-1629524947) or [JavaScript](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/09/how-a-new-html-element-will-make-the-web-faster/?comments=1&post=27499297#comment-27499297), referendums on [responsive design](http://beta.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=5619865&cid=47810153) and [XML](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8256664), [nostalgia](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/09/how-a-new-html-element-will-make-the-web-faster/?comments=1&post=27507917#comment-27507917), [wackadoodle trolling](http://beta.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=5602569&cid=47789507), [a call to return to table-based layouts](http://beta.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=5602569&cid=47790359), [nonsensical arrangements of words](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/09/how-a-new-html-element-will-make-the-web-faster/?comments=1&post=27502091#comment-27502091) and even the odd [good idea](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/09/how-a-new-html-element-will-make-the-web-faster/?comments=1&post=27499215#comment-27499215).

You know what? I love the internet.

## Growing up

Meanwhile, Yoav’s Blink implementation of the spec has – [with some fanfare](http://blog.chromium.org/2014/08/chrome-38-beta-new-primitives-for-next.html) – made it’s way from Chrome Canary into the [Chrome Beta](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/beta.html) channel. Huzzah!

Here I’ll remind you that that same implementation is slated to ship to millions of Chrome stable users in 3-4 weeks. When it does, [we’ll be able to track developer usage](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=408797) on the excellent [chromestatus.com](http://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/popularity). I, for one, very much look forward to having a front-row seat from which to watch the responsive-image-ification of the web in real time.

## Oh and [we’re big in Japan](http://kia-king.com/blog/tutorial/responsive-images-with-srcset/)

[Germany, too](http://blog.kulturbanause.de/2014/09/responsive-images-srcset-sizes-adaptive/)

See you in a couple of weeks!
